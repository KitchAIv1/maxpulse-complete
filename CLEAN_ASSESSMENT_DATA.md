# 🗑️ CLEAN ASSESSMENT DATA - FRESH START

## 📋 INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
3. **Run the following SQL commands in order**

## 🔧 SQL COMMANDS TO EXECUTE:

### Step 1: Delete Assessment Tracking Data
```sql
DELETE FROM assessment_tracking;
```

### Step 2: Delete Client Assessments Data
```sql
DELETE FROM client_assessments;
```

### Step 3: Delete Assessments Data
```sql
DELETE FROM assessments;
```

### Step 4: Verify Tables Are Empty
```sql
SELECT 'assessment_tracking' as table_name, COUNT(*) as record_count FROM assessment_tracking
UNION ALL
SELECT 'client_assessments' as table_name, COUNT(*) as record_count FROM client_assessments  
UNION ALL
SELECT 'assessments' as table_name, COUNT(*) as record_count FROM assessments;
```

## ✅ EXPECTED RESULT:

## 🎯 WHAT THIS DOES:

## 🚀 AFTER CLEANUP:
- New assessments will start fresh with consistent format

- Real-time tracking will work perfectly
- No old format conflicts

## ⚠️ WARNING:
This will permanently delete all assessment history. Make sure this is what you want before proceeding.
