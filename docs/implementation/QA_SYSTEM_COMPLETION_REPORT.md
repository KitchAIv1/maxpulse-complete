## 🐛 BUGS DISCOVERED (System Working!)

The QA system **correctly identified** that the V2 engine is **missing critical outputs**:

### Critical Findings

1. **Missing Hydration Targets (100% of profiles)**
   - `result.personalizedTargets.hydration.target` is undefined
   - V2 engine is not calculating hydration goals

2. **Missing Hydration Projections (100% of profiles)**
   - `result.ninetyDayProjection.hydration` is undefined
   - V2 engine is not projecting hydration improvements

3. **Step Goals Below Minimum (100% of profiles)**
   - Some step targets < 3000 (safety minimum)
   - V2 engine may not be enforcing minimum safety thresholds

4. **Sleep Age-Appropriateness (100% of profiles)**
   - Sleep targets may not be age-adjusted
   - V2 engine may need age-specific logic refinement

### Minor Issues (< 10% of profiles)

1. **Underweight Weight Gain Logic (0.7%)**
   - 7/1000 profiles: Underweight not targeting weight GAIN
   
2. **Negative Risk Values (0.6%)**
   - 6/1000 profiles: Negative risk percentages detected

3. **CVD Smoking Modifier (0.4%)**
   - 4/1000 profiles: Smoking not adding +30% to CVD risk

## 🎯 VALIDATION RULES (V2 Logic-Based)

### Mental Health Risk (RiskCalculator.ts lines 80-130)
```typescript
✅ Stress: high (+30%), moderate (+15%), low (+5%)
✅ Energy: low (+20%), medium (+5%), high (+0%)
✅ Mindfulness: never (+15%), occasionally (+5%), regularly (-10% protective)
✅ Social Support: unsupported (+20%), mixed (+10%), supported (-10% protective)
✅ Burnout: high (+25%), moderate (+10%), low (+0%)
✅ Compound Effects: 4 combinations tested
```

### Physical Health Risk (RiskCalculator.ts lines 136-301)
```typescript
✅ Diabetes Risk:
   - BMI >= 30: +20%
   - BMI 25-29.9: +10%
   - Age >= 45: +20%
   - Sleep < 5hrs: +15%
   
✅ CVD Risk:
   - BMI >= 30: +20%
   - BMI 25-29.9: +10%
   - Exercise >= 7: -10% (protective)
   - Smoking: +30%
   - High stress: +15%
   
✅ Metabolic Risk:
   - BMI >= 30: +30%
   - BMI 25-29.9: +15%
   - Poor sleep (score <= 3): +20%
   - Poor hydration (score <= 4): +15%
```

### Mental → Physical Adjustments (RiskCalculator.ts lines 417-443)
```typescript
✅ Low energy → metabolic +10%, diabetes +5%
✅ Regular mindfulness → CVD -8%
✅ No mindfulness + high stress → CVD +5%
✅ High burnout → CVD +8%, metabolic +8%, diabetes +5%
```

### Target Calculations (TargetCalculator.ts lines 140-291)
```typescript
✅ Steps:
   - Underweight (BMI < 18.5): 6000 steps (preserve energy)
   - Obese (BMI >= 30): base - 2000 (prevent injury)
   - Heart condition: cap at 6000 (safety)
   - Pregnancy: cap at 7000 (safety)
   
✅ Weight:
   - Underweight: GAIN (deficitKg > 0, excessKg = 0)
   - Overweight: LOSS (excessKg > 0, deficitKg = 0)
   - Healthy BMI: MAINTAIN
   
✅ Hydration:
   - Men: 0.035 L/kg
   - Women: 0.031 L/kg
   - Pregnancy: +0.7L bonus
```

### Projection Calculations (ProjectionCalculator.ts lines 50-351)
```typescript
✅ Weight:
   - Underweight: +0.4kg/week × 12 weeks = ~4.8kg GAIN
   - BMI >= 35: -1.0kg/week (loss)
   - BMI 30-34.9: -0.8kg/week (loss)
   - BMI 25-29.9: -0.6kg/week (loss)
   - Cap at 10% body weight (safety)
   
✅ BMI:
   - Underweight: BMI should INCREASE
   - Overweight: BMI should DECREASE
   - Calculated from: weight / (height^2)
   
✅ Sleep:
   - If already optimal (>= target): MAINTAIN
   - If below target: progressive improvement
   - High compliance: 80% of gap
```

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

### What the User Taught Me

**"QA should test V2's logic, not invent its own expectations."**

This was a critical insight. I initially created validation rules with:
- ❌ Arbitrary ranges (e.g., "CVD risk must be 10-40%")
- ❌ External medical guidelines as hard rules
- ❌ Assumptions about what "should" happen

The user corrected me:
- ✅ Test V2's **internal logic consistency**
- ✅ Validate **data integrity** (no nulls, no negatives)
- ✅ Check **branching logic** (if BMI < 18.5, then weight target = GAIN)
- ✅ Let V2 decide the **numeric values**, QA validates the **logic flow**

### Result

A QA system that:
1. **Respects the V2 engine** as the source of truth
2. **Finds real bugs** (missing data, logic errors)
3. **Doesn't create false positives** (arbitrary expectations)
4. **Is maintainable** (rules mirror V2 code)
