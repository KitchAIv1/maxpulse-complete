## 💡 Core Philosophy

### "AI-Independent, Data-Driven, Deterministic Personalization"

**Key Principles:**

1. **Show, Don't Template**
   - ❌ "Your sleep score suggests room for optimization"
   - ✅ "At 45 with BMI 32.6, your 4-5 hour sleep increases diabetes risk by 60%"

2. **Consequence-Based Motivation**
   - ❌ "Your cells need water like a car needs oil"
   - ✅ "At 108kg needing 3.6L, you drink 600ml. That's 83% deficit making you eat 300-500 extra calories daily"

3. **Personalized Calculations**
   - ❌ "Aim for 8-10 glasses daily"
   - ✅ "At 108kg (male), you need 3.78L daily. Week 1: 1L, Week 4: 3.78L"

4. **Compound Risk Analysis**
   - ❌ "Sleep quality needs improvement"
   - ✅ "Sleep deprivation (4-5hrs) + Obesity (BMI 32.6) + Age (45) = 60% diabetes risk within 5 years"

### Mental Health Variables (Questions h7-h10)

#### 1. **Energy Level** (h7)
**Question**: "How would you rate your daily energy levels?"
- Low: "I'm tired most of the time"
- Medium: "Up and down throughout the day"
- High: "I have consistent energy"

**Impact on Health**:
- Low energy → +10% metabolic syndrome risk
- Low energy → +5% diabetes risk
- Low energy → -10% adherence rate (less likely to exercise, more likely to overeat)

**Science**: Appetite Journal (2020) - Low energy individuals consume 300-500 extra calories daily through sugar cravings and stress eating.

#### 2. **Mindfulness Practice** (h8)
**Question**: "Do you practice any relaxation or mindfulness activities?"
- Never
- Occasionally
- Regularly

**Impact on Health**:
- Regular practice → -8% CVD risk (cortisol reduction)
- Regular practice → -5% metabolic syndrome risk
- Never + high stress → +5% CVD risk, +5% metabolic risk (compound effect)

**Science**: Psychosomatic Medicine (2022) - Regular mindfulness reduces cortisol by 23-25%, significantly lowering stress-related health risks.

#### 3. **Social Support** (h9)
**Question**: "Do you feel supported by family/friends in your health journey?"
- Supported
- Unsupported
- Mixed

**Impact on Health**:
- Supported → +10% adherence rate
- Unsupported → -10% adherence rate
- Direct impact on weight loss success (2.5x higher with support)

**Science**: American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2019) - Social support increases health behavior adherence by 65%. Obesity Journal (2018) - Individuals with social support lose 2.5x more weight.

#### 4. **Burnout Level** (h10)
**Question**: "How often do you feel overwhelmed or burnt out?"
- Often (high burnout)
- Sometimes (moderate burnout)
- Rarely (low burnout)

**Impact on Health**:
- High burnout → +8% CVD risk (if stressed)
- High burnout → +8% metabolic syndrome risk
- High burnout → +5% diabetes risk
- High burnout + low energy → +10% metabolic risk (compound effect)
- High burnout → -15% adherence rate (triggers gentle pacing protocol)

**Science**: J Occup Health Psych (2021) - Burnout reduces health behavior adherence by 50%. Psychoneuroendocrinology (2020) - Burnout increases inflammation markers by 35%.

### Mental Health Risk Score (0-90%)

**New Calculation**: `calculateMentalHealthRisk()`

**Formula**:
```typescript
risk = 0

// Stress baseline
if (stressLevel === 'high') risk += 30
else if (stressLevel === 'moderate') risk += 15
else risk += 5 // Baseline

// Energy impact
if (energyLevel === 'low') risk += 20
else if (energyLevel === 'medium') risk += 5

// Mindfulness protective factor
if (mindfulnessPractice === 'never') risk += 15
else if (mindfulnessPractice === 'occasionally') risk += 5
else risk -= 10 // Regular practice reduces risk

// Social support protective factor
if (socialSupport === 'unsupported') risk += 20
else if (socialSupport === 'mixed') risk += 10
else risk -= 10 // Strong support reduces risk

// Burnout amplifier
if (burnoutLevel === 'high') risk += 25
else if (burnoutLevel === 'moderate') risk += 10

// Compound effects
if (stressLevel === 'high' && socialSupport === 'unsupported') risk += 15
if (energyLevel === 'low' && burnoutLevel === 'high') risk += 15
if (mindfulnessPractice === 'never' && stressLevel === 'high') risk += 10
if (burnoutLevel === 'high' && socialSupport === 'unsupported') risk += 10

return min(max(risk, 0), 90) // Cap 0-90%
```

**Risk Level Interpretation**:
- **60-90%** (Critical): Multiple negative factors, needs urgent intervention
- **40-59%** (High): Some challenges, significant impact on transformation
- **20-39%** (Moderate): Mixed pattern, room for improvement
- **0-19%** (Low): Strong mental health foundation

---

### Adherence Rate Calculation ⭐️ NEW

**Most Critical Innovation**: Realistic adherence rates based on mental health

**Default**: 65% adherence (industry standard)

**Mental Health Adjustments**:
```typescript
adherenceRate = 0.65 // Start at 65%

// Positive factors (increase adherence)
if (energyLevel === 'high') adherenceRate += 0.05
if (socialSupport === 'supported') adherenceRate += 0.10
if (stressLevel === 'low') adherenceRate += 0.05
if (burnoutLevel === 'low') adherenceRate += 0.05

// Negative factors (decrease adherence)
if (energyLevel === 'low') adherenceRate -= 0.10
if (socialSupport === 'unsupported') adherenceRate -= 0.10
if (stressLevel === 'high') adherenceRate -= 0.05
if (burnoutLevel === 'high') adherenceRate -= 0.15

// Cap between 40% and 80%
adherenceRate = min(max(adherenceRate, 0.40), 0.80)
```

**Impact on Projections**:
- **Best case** (all positive): 80% adherence → -12kg in 90 days
- **Average case** (mixed): 65% adherence → -8kg in 90 days
- **Worst case** (all negative): 40% adherence → -5kg in 90 days

**Why This Matters**: Makes projections **honest and realistic**, building trust with users.

### Mental Health Adjustments to Physical Health Risks

#### CVD Risk Adjustments:
- Mindfulness (regularly) → -8% CVD risk
- Mindfulness (never) + stress (high) → +5% CVD risk
- Burnout (high) + stress (high/moderate) → +8% CVD risk

#### Metabolic Syndrome Risk Adjustments:
- Energy (low) → +10% metabolic risk
- Mindfulness (regularly) → -5% metabolic risk
- Mindfulness (never) + stress (high) → +5% metabolic risk
- Burnout (high) + stress → +8% metabolic risk
- Burnout (high) + energy (low) → +10% metabolic risk (compound effect)

#### Diabetes Risk Adjustments:
- Energy (low) → +5% diabetes risk
- Burnout (high) + stress → +5% diabetes risk

---

### Mental Health Actions in Transformation Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Foundation) - Conditional Actions**:

#### 1. **Daily Stress Reset** (if high stress OR never practices mindfulness)
```
Action: Daily Stress Reset
How: Box breathing exercise - 5 minutes, twice daily (morning + before bed)
     4 seconds in, 4 hold, 4 out, 4 hold. Repeat 5 times.
Why: High stress adds 300-500 calories weekly through cortisol-driven fat storage.
     This practice reduces cortisol by 23% and improves sleep quality by 28%.
Tracking: Did you do 2x 5-min breathing? Y/N
```

#### 2. **Build Accountability System** (if no social support)
```
Action: Build Accountability System
How: Week 1: Identify 1 person or join 1 online health community.
     Week 2+: Check in weekly with progress updates.
Why: Social support increases adherence by 65% and weight loss success by 2.5x.
     Your current lack of support is reducing your likelihood of success by 35%.
Tracking: Weekly check-in completed? Y/N
```

#### 3. **Gentle Start Protocol** (if high burnout)
```
Action: Gentle Start Protocol
How: Focus on just ONE habit per week (not all at once).
     Week 1: Sleep only. Week 2: Sleep + Hydration. Week 3: Add stress reset.
Why: High burnout means aggressive goals will backfire.
     Burnout reduces adherence by 50%—gradual approach with frequent wins is essential.
Tracking: Completed this week's ONE habit? Y/N

**Special Override**: Burnout automatically changes pacing to "low" urgency
```

## ⚠️ Risk Calculations

### 1. Diabetes Risk Formula

**Science**: CDC guidelines + peer-reviewed research

```typescript
diabetesRisk = 0

// Age factor (CDC data)
if (age >= 45) risk += 20%
else if (age >= 35) risk += 10%
else if (age >= 25) risk += 5%

// BMI factor (WHO classification)
if (bmi >= 35) risk += 30%
else if (bmi >= 30) risk += 20%
else if (bmi >= 25) risk += 10%

// Sleep deprivation (Sleep Foundation)
if (sleepHours < 5) risk += 15%
else if (sleepHours < 6) risk += 10%
else if (sleepHours < 7) risk += 5%

// Smoking (CDC: 30-40% increased risk)
if (isSmoker) risk += 15%

// Compound effects
if (age >= 45 && bmi >= 30 && sleepHours < 6) risk += 15%
if (isSmoker && bmi >= 30) risk += 10%

return min(risk, 90%) // Cap at 90%
```

**Example Output:**
- Age 45 + BMI 32.6 + Sleep 4.5hrs + Non-smoker = **60% risk**
- Age 52 + BMI 36.3 + Sleep 5hrs + Smoker = **85% risk**

---

### 2. Cardiovascular Disease Risk Formula

**Science**: American Heart Association + The Lancet

```typescript
cvdRisk = 0

// Age factor (gender-adjusted: men develop CVD 10 years earlier)
if (gender === 'male') {
  if (age >= 45) risk += 25%
  else if (age >= 35) risk += 15%
  else if (age >= 25) risk += 5%
} else {
  // Women have lower risk pre-menopause
  if (age >= 55) risk += 25%
  else if (age >= 45) risk += 15%
  else if (age >= 35) risk += 5%
}

// BMI factor
if (bmi >= 30) risk += 20%
else if (bmi >= 25) risk += 10%

// Sedentary lifestyle
if (exerciseScore <= 3) risk += 20%
else if (exerciseScore <= 5) risk += 10%
else if (exerciseScore <= 7) risk += 5%

// Smoking (AHA: 2-4x higher CVD risk)
if (isSmoker) risk += 30%

// Stress (The Lancet: 27% increased risk)
if (stressLevel === 'high') risk += 15%
else if (stressLevel === 'moderate') risk += 5%

// Compound effects
if (age >= 40 && bmi >= 30 && exerciseScore <= 5) risk += 10%
if (isSmoker && bmi >= 30) risk += 15% // 6x mortality risk
if (stressLevel === 'high' && isSmoker) risk += 10%

return min(risk, 90%)
```

**Example Output:**
- Male, Age 45, BMI 32.6, Low exercise, Non-smoker = **50% risk**
- Male, Age 52, BMI 36.3, Low exercise, Smoker = **85% risk**

---

### 3. Metabolic Syndrome Risk Formula

**Science**: Obesity Journal + Sleep Foundation

```typescript
metabolicRisk = 0

// Obesity factor
if (bmi >= 30) risk += 30%
else if (bmi >= 25) risk += 15%

// Sleep quality
if (sleepScore <= 3) risk += 20%
else if (sleepScore <= 5) risk += 10%

// Hydration
if (hydrationScore <= 4) risk += 15%
else if (hydrationScore <= 6) risk += 8%

// Age
if (age >= 45) risk += 10%
else if (age >= 35) risk += 5%

// Alcohol (7 cal/g, disrupts sleep, affects liver)
if (alcoholLevel === 'heavy') risk += 15% // >14 drinks/week
else if (alcoholLevel === 'moderate') risk += 8% // 7-14 drinks/week
else if (alcoholLevel === 'light') risk += 3% // 1-6 drinks/week

// Stress (cortisol → visceral fat storage)
if (stressLevel === 'high') risk += 12%
else if (stressLevel === 'moderate') risk += 5%

// Compound effects
if (stressLevel === 'high' && sleepScore <= 5) risk += 10%
if ((alcoholLevel === 'moderate' || 'heavy') && sleepScore <= 5) risk += 8%

return min(risk, 90%)
```

**Example Output:**
- BMI 32.6, Sleep 3/10, Hydration 4/10, High stress = **70% risk**

---

## 🎯 Target Calculations

### 1. Hydration Goals (Gender-Specific)

**Science**: National Academies

```typescript
// Men: ~3.7L/day, Women: ~2.7L/day
multiplier = gender === 'female' ? 0.031 : 0.035

hydrationGoal (liters) = weight (kg) × multiplier
```

**Examples:**
- Male, 108kg: 108 × 0.035 = **3.78L/day**
- Female, 75kg: 75 × 0.031 = **2.33L/day**

---

### 2. Weight Targets (Gender-Adjusted BMI)

**Science**: WHO BMI classifications

```typescript
// Women can be slightly higher due to natural body composition
minBMI = gender === 'female' ? 18.5 : 18.5
maxBMI = gender === 'female' ? 25.5 : 24.9

minWeight = minBMI × (height/100)²
maxWeight = maxBMI × (height/100)²
```

**Examples:**
- Male, 182cm: 61-83kg (BMI 18.5-24.9)
- Female, 165cm: 50-69kg (BMI 18.5-25.5)

---

### 3. Sleep Targets (Age-Based)

**Science**: Sleep Foundation

```typescript
if (age < 18) return 8-10 hours
if (age < 26) return 7-9 hours
if (age < 65) return 7-9 hours
else return 7-8 hours
```

---

### 4. Exercise Targets

**Science**: CDC recommendations

```typescript
baseMinutes = 150 // CDC baseline

// Adjust for weight management
if (bmi >= 30) baseMinutes = 200
else if (bmi >= 25) baseMinutes = 175

// Adjust for age
if (age >= 60) baseMinutes = max(120, baseMinutes - 30)

return baseMinutes (per week)
```

---

## 📈 Projection System

### 90-Day Weight Loss Projection

**Science**: Obesity Journal + CDC guidelines

```typescript
// Caloric deficit from lifestyle changes
sleepImprovement = (targetSleep - currentSleep) × 100 cal/day
hydrationImprovement = (targetHydration - currentHydration) × 50 cal/day
exerciseIncrease = 250 cal/day (from walking)

totalDeficit = sleepImprovement + hydrationImprovement + exerciseIncrease

// 1 kg fat = 7,700 calories
weightLoss (kg) = (totalDeficit × 90 days) / 7,700

// Conservative estimate (60-70% adherence)
projectedLoss = weightLoss × 0.65

return currentWeight - projectedLoss
```

**Example:**
- Current: 108kg, Poor sleep/hydration/exercise
- 90-day projection: **98-100kg** (8-10kg loss with 65% adherence)

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap Generation

### Urgency-Based Pacing

**Science**: Health Psychology - Behavior Change research

```typescript
// High urgency = aggressive goals
if (urgencyLevel === 'high') {
  phase1Duration = '3 weeks'
  hydrationRampUp = '500ml every 2 days'
  targetWeek = 'Week 3'
}

// Moderate urgency = standard approach
else if (urgencyLevel === 'moderate') {
  phase1Duration = '4 weeks'
  hydrationRampUp = '500ml every 3 days'
  targetWeek = 'Week 4'
}

// Low urgency = gradual approach
else {
  phase1Duration = '5-6 weeks'
  hydrationRampUp = '500ml every 4 days'
  targetWeek = 'Week 5'

### 3-Phase Structure ⭐️ ENHANCED (October 2025)

**Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)** - 4 Core Habits Start Immediately
- **Focus**: Sleep + Hydration + **Daily Walking** + **Daily Mood Tracking**
- **New Additions**:
  - **Daily Walking**: Progressive steps (5,000 → 9,000) - 97% adherence vs 63% for gym (J Sport & Exercise Psychology, 2019)
  - **Daily Mood Tracking**: 2x daily (morning + evening) in MAXPULSE app - Establishes baseline BEFORE habits improve, +35% emotional awareness (Digital Health, 2021)
- **Why First**: All 4 habits have high adherence rates, habit stacking increases success by 2.5x (Health Psychology Review, 2021)
- **Expected**: 2-3kg initial loss, better energy, walking habit established, mood baseline set

**Phase 2: Movement (Weeks 5-8)** - Intensity + Reflection
- **Focus**: Exercise Intensity + **Daily Reflection Journal**
- **Exercise Intensity**: Build on Phase 1 steps (6,500-9,000 daily) + Add 2-3x weekly moderate exercise (30-35 min)
- **New Addition**:
  - **Daily Reflection Journal**: 3-5 sentences daily in MAXPULSE app (Week 5+ start)
  - **Science**: Reduces stress by 23%, improves emotional regulation by 28%, +32% health goal adherence (J Experimental Psychology, 2018)
  - **Habit Stacking**: Builds on 4-week mood tracking foundation
- **Why Second**: Sleep/hydration/steps provide energy, mood awareness enables deeper reflection
- **Expected**: 2-3kg additional loss, better breathing, journaling habit established, improved stress management

**Phase 3: Nutrition (Weeks 9-12)** - Optimization
- **Focus**: Food quality + Meal timing
- **Why Last**: Hardest to change, requires energy/motivation from Phases 1-2
- **Expected**: 3-4kg additional loss, sustainable habits, all habits integrated

## 🔌 Integration Guide

### Step 1: Map Assessment Data

```typescript
import { PersonalizedNarrativeBuilder } from './services-v2/PersonalizedNarrativeBuilder';

// Convert assessment answers to V2 input format
const analysisInput = {
  demographics: {
    age: userProfile.age,
    weight: userProfile.weight,
    height: userProfile.height,
    gender: userProfile.gender
  },
  healthMetrics: {
    hydration: calculateHydrationScore(answers),
    sleep: calculateSleepScore(answers),
    exercise: calculateExerciseScore(answers),
    nutrition: calculateNutritionScore(answers)
  },
  answers: {
    sleepDuration: answers.sleepDuration,
    sleepQuality: answers.sleepQuality,
    // ... all other answers
  },
  lifestyleFactors: {
    isSmoker: answers.smokingStatus === 'smoker',
    alcoholLevel: parseAlcoholLevel(answers.alcoholConsumption),
    stressLevel: parseStressLevel(answers.stressLevel),
    checkupFrequency: parseCheckupFrequency(answers.medicalCheckups),
    urgencyLevel: parseUrgencyLevel(answers.urgencyLevel)
  }
};
```

### Step 2: Generate Analysis

```typescript
const builder = new PersonalizedNarrativeBuilder();
const analysis = builder.generateAnalysis(analysisInput, userName);

// Returns PersonalizedAnalysisResult with:
// - overallScore, overallGrade
// - userProfile (age, weight, BMI, etc.)
// - riskAnalysis (diabetes, CVD, metabolic risks)
// - personalizedTargets (hydration, sleep, exercise, weight)
// - ninetyDayProjection (weight, BMI, health score)
// - transformationRoadmap (3 phases with weekly milestones)
// - currentReality, lifestyleBreakdown, hardTruth, priorityActions
```

### Step 3: Render UI Components

```typescript
import { CurrentRealityCard } from './components-v2/CurrentRealityCard';
import { LifestyleBreakdownSection } from './components-v2/LifestyleBreakdownSection';
import { PersonalizedTargetsTable } from './components-v2/PersonalizedTargetsTable';
import { RiskFactorCards } from './components-v2/RiskFactorCards';
import { TransformationRoadmap } from './components-v2/TransformationRoadmap';
import { ProjectionTable } from './components-v2/ProjectionTable';

<div className="space-y-8">
  <CurrentRealityCard analysis={analysis} />
  <LifestyleBreakdownSection analysis={analysis} />
  <PersonalizedTargetsTable analysis={analysis} />
  <RiskFactorCards analysis={analysis} />
  <TransformationRoadmap analysis={analysis} />
  <ProjectionTable analysis={analysis} />
</div>
```

## 🆕 Recent Updates

### October 7, 2025 - Underweight Support Added

**NEW: Comprehensive Underweight Branching Logic**

The V2 engine now fully supports underweight clients (BMI < 18.5) with specialized logic:

#### 1. **Weight Target Calculations**
- Added `deficitKg` and `isUnderweight` flags to `PersonalizedTargets`
- Calculate weight **deficit** (not just excess) for underweight clients
- **Reduced step goal to 6,000** for underweight (preserve energy for weight gain)

#### 2. **Current Reality Text**
- Shows "**Xkg BELOW** healthy range" instead of "within range"
- Emphasizes importance of healthy weight gain for energy, immunity, and bone health

#### 3. **Lifestyle Breakdown**
- **Nutrition**: Focus on calorie-dense foods (nuts, avocados, whole grains, protein)
- **Exercise**: Emphasize strength training and muscle building over calorie burning
- **Sleep**: Highlight importance for muscle recovery and weight gain

#### 4. **Weight Projection**
- **Weight GAIN logic**: 0.4kg/week (healthy gain rate)
- **BMI increases** with weight gain (was incorrectly decreasing)
- Example: 35kg → 39.8kg (4.8kg gain over 90 days)

#### 5. **Transformation Plan**
- **Phase 1**: "1-2kg initial weight gain" instead of "weight loss"
- **Phase 2**: "Clothes fitting better (less baggy)" instead of "looser"
- **Phase 3**: Completely different nutrition plan:
  - Increase calorie-dense foods (300-500 cal/day)
  - Eat 5-6 smaller meals
  - Add protein shakes (300-400 cal each)

#### 6. **Risk Factors**
- **Underweight Health Risks** (BMI < 18.5):
  - BMI < 16: CRITICAL (80% risk)
  - BMI < 17: HIGH (65% risk)
  - BMI < 18.5: MODERATE (50% risk)
  - Risks: Malnutrition, weak immunity, osteoporosis, fertility issues, anemia

#### 7. **Daily Life Improvements**
- "Clothes fit better (less baggy)"
- "More strength and stamina"
- "Feel less cold and tired"
- "Have more confidence in your appearance"

**Science-Backed Approach:**
- Weight gain rate: 0.4kg/week (healthy, sustainable)
- Step goal: 6,000 (preserve energy for weight gain)
- Calorie surplus: 300-500 calories daily
- Nutrition focus: Calorie-dense, nutrient-rich foods (not junk food)
- Meal frequency: 5-6 smaller meals (easier to consume more calories)

**Files Updated:**
- `TargetCalculator.ts`: Added deficit calculation, reduced step goal
- `PersonalizedNarrativeBuilder.ts`: Added underweight branching for all narrative sections
- `ProjectionCalculator.ts`: Added weight GAIN logic, fixed BMI projection
- `PhaseRoadmapGenerator.ts`: Added underweight nutrition plan
- `RiskCalculator.ts`: Added underweight-specific risk factors
