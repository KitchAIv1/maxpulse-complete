# 🧪 TEST SUPABASE INTEGRATION

## ✅ FIXES APPLIED

### 1. **Fixed Link Generation**
- ✅ Updated `LinkGeneration.tsx` to use port **5175** instead of 3000
- ✅ Added `VITE_ASSESSMENT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5175/assessment` to dashboard env
- ✅ Restarted dashboard server to pick up changes

### 2. **Enhanced Debugging**
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging to assessment `App.tsx`
- ✅ Feature flag status logging
- ✅ Manager initialization success/failure logging

### 3. **UUID Resolution System**
- ✅ Created `DistributorResolver.ts` service
- ✅ Updated `AssessmentCompletionManager.ts` to use UUID resolution
- ✅ Updated `SupabaseDualWriteManager.ts` to use UUID resolution

## 🎯 TESTING STEPS

### Step 1: Generate New Link
1. Go to dashboard: `http://localhost:3000`
2. Navigate to **Link Generation** tab
3. Fill in customer details:
   - Name: "Test User"
   - Email: "test@example.com"
4. Click **Generate Link**
5. **VERIFY**: Link should now point to `localhost:5175/assessment`

### Step 2: Test Assessment with Supabase Integration
1. Click the generated link (should open `localhost:5175/assessment`)
2. **LOOK FOR LOGS** in browser console:
   ```
   🔄 Initializing Supabase managers... {debugMode: true, useSupabase: true, ...}
   🔄 Dual-write manager initialized: true
   🔄 Completion manager initialized: true
   🔄 Real-time manager initialized: true
   ✅ All Supabase managers initialization complete
   ```
3. Start assessment and answer questions
4. **LOOK FOR TRACKING LOGS**:
   ```
   🔍 Distributor resolved: {original: "SJ2024", resolved: "uuid-here"}
   ✅ Supabase write successful for session: session_...
   ```
5. Complete assessment
6. **LOOK FOR COMPLETION LOGS**:
   ```
   🎯 Assessment completion processed: {success: true, ...}
   ```

### Step 3: Verify Database Population
Use the corrected SQL queries from `CORRECTED_DATABASE_QUERIES.sql`:

```sql
-- Check recent activity
SELECT * FROM assessment_tracking 
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- Check table counts
SELECT 'assessment_tracking' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM assessment_tracking
UNION ALL
SELECT 'assessments' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM assessments
UNION ALL  
SELECT 'clients' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM clients
UNION ALL
SELECT 'client_assessments' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM client_assessments;
```

## 🎯 EXPECTED RESULTS

### ✅ Console Logs Should Show:
- Supabase managers initializing
- Distributor ID resolution (SJ2024 → UUID)
- Database writes succeeding
- Assessment completion processing

### ✅ Database Should Populate:
- `assessment_tracking` - Step-by-step progress
- `assessments` - Assessment records
- `clients` - Client records  
- `client_assessments` - Link table

## 🚨 IF STILL NOT WORKING

Check these common issues:
1. **Browser cache** - Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Environment variables** - Restart both servers
3. **Port conflicts** - Ensure assessment is on 5175
4. **Feature flags** - Verify `VITE_DATABASE_SUBSCRIPTIONS=true`

**The link generation fix should resolve the port mismatch issue!** 🎯
