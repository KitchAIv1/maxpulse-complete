# Backend & Database Engineering Rules
# Enforces production-grade standards from Day 0
# Last Updated: October 2025

## 🚨 MANDATORY ENFORCEMENT - NO EXCEPTIONS

### Database Hygiene (Day 0)

**REFUSE** any code that:
- Creates tables without PRIMARY KEY
- References foreign keys without index on FK column
- Queries tables >50k rows without indexes on JOIN/WHERE/ORDER BY columns
- Adds `created_at`/`updated_at` without indexes when used in sorting
- Uses `SELECT *` in production code (explicitly list columns)
- Creates compound queries without composite indexes

**REQUIRED** for every migration:
```sql
-- Index all foreign keys
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_id ON orders(user_id);

-- Composite indexes for common query patterns
CREATE INDEX idx_users_tenant_created ON users(tenant_id, created_at DESC);

-- Partial indexes for filtered queries
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_active ON orders(user_id, status) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

**DATABASE MONITORING** (Required Day 0):
- Enable `pg_stat_statements` extension
- Reject queries with `Seq Scan` on tables >50k rows
- Set `statement_timeout = 30s` globally
- Connection pool: 20-30 max for small instances

**QUERY PERFORMANCE CHECKLIST**:
```sql
-- Every query must pass:
EXPLAIN ANALYZE [your query];
-- Check for:
- [ ] No sequential scans on large tables
- [ ] Index usage confirmed
- [ ] Execution time <50ms for reads
- [ ] Execution time <200ms for writes
```

### Authentication & Security (Day 0)

**REFUSE** any code that:
- Implements auth without token expiry (Access: ≤15min, Refresh: ≤7 days)
- Skips refresh token rotation on use
- Creates user-data tables without RLS enabled
- Adds endpoints without rate limiting (login: 5/min, writes: 30/min)
- Exposes data across tenant boundaries
- Stores passwords without bcrypt/argon2 (min 12 rounds)

**REQUIRED** auth checklist for every protected endpoint:
```typescript
// Authentication Middleware Requirements:
- [ ] Bearer token validation (JWT verify)
- [ ] Token expiry check (reject expired tokens)
- [ ] Tenant ID extracted from token claims
- [ ] RLS policy enforces tenant_id match
- [ ] Rate limit middleware applied
- [ ] Revocation check (Redis lookup for logout)
- [ ] CORS policy defined (no wildcard in production)
```

**ROW LEVEL SECURITY (RLS) Template**:
```sql
-- Enable RLS on all user-data tables
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy: Users can only see their own tenant's data
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON users
  FOR ALL
  USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant_id')::uuid);

-- Service role bypass (for admin operations)
CREATE POLICY service_role_all ON users
  FOR ALL
  USING (current_setting('role') = 'service_role');
```

**RATE LIMITING** (Required):
```typescript
// Rate limit configuration
const rateLimits = {
  login: { requests: 5, window: 60 },      // 5 attempts per minute
  signup: { requests: 3, window: 3600 },   // 3 signups per hour
  writes: { requests: 30, window: 60 },    // 30 writes per minute per user
  reads: { requests: 100, window: 60 },    // 100 reads per minute per user
};
```

---

### Minimal Test Coverage (Day 0)

**REFUSE** PRs that:
- Remove or skip smoke tests
- Break the smoke suite (must complete in <30s)
- Don't include migration smoke tests for schema changes
- Skip integration tests for payment flows

**REQUIRED** smoke test flow:
```gherkin
Feature: Core Authentication & Authorization
  Scenario: Complete auth flow with tenant isolation
    Given clean database
    When user signs up with email
    And user logs in (receives access + refresh tokens)
    And user creates resource with tenant_id
    And user reads own resource
    Then user can read own resource
    And user CANNOT read other tenant's resources
    And invalid tokens are rejected
    And revoked tokens fail authentication
    And expired tokens are rejected
```

**REQUIRED** for database migrations:
```bash
# Every migration must have:
- [ ] Up migration (forward)
- [ ] Down migration (rollback)
- [ ] Seed data survives migration round-trip
- [ ] Indexes created CONCURRENTLY (no table locks)
- [ ] Migration tested on production-like data volume
```

---

### Cost & Infrastructure Sanity (Day 0)

**REFUSE** configurations that:
- Deploy without autoscaling limits (min=1, max defined)
- Create preview environments without TTL (max 48h)
- Skip CDN/proxy layer (Cloudflare/Vercel Edge required)
- Retain logs >14 days without explicit approval
- Set connection pools >50 without justification
- Create compute resources without monitoring alerts

**ENFORCE** deployment configuration:
```yaml
# deployment.yml - Required for all environments
compute:
  min_instances: 1
  max_instances: 3
  cpu_threshold: 70%
  memory_threshold: 80%
  
preview_environments:
  ttl_hours: 24
  auto_destroy: true
  max_concurrent: 3

logging:
  retention_days: 14
  level: "info"  # "debug" only in dev
  
database:
  max_connections: 25
  connection_timeout: 10s
  statement_timeout: 30s
  idle_in_transaction_timeout: 60s

cdn:
  provider: "cloudflare"  # or "vercel_edge"
  cache_static: true
  cache_api: false
```

**COST MONITORING** (Automated):
```javascript
// Auto-create tickets for cost optimization
if (avgCPU < 15% && duration > 7 days) {
  createTicket({
    title: "🔻 Consider downsizing instance",
    priority: "low",
    savings: `$${estimateSavings()}/month`
  });
}

if (avgMemory > 85% && duration > 3 days) {
  createTicket({
    title: "⚠️ Memory pressure detected",
    priority: "high",
    action: "Investigate memory leaks or scale up"
  });
}
```

## 📊 MVP PHASE (Weeks 1-2) - Soft Gates

### CI Quality Checks (Warnings Only)

**ADD** these checks that **warn but don't fail builds**:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/quality-gates.yml
quality_checks:
  - name: Check FK Indexes
    run: node scripts/check-fk-indexes.js || echo "⚠️ Missing FK indexes"
    
  - name: Secret Scanning
    run: gitleaks detect --no-git || echo "⚠️ Potential secrets found"
  
  - name: Query Performance Audit
    run: |
      psql -f perf/explain-plans.sql > perf/current.txt
      diff perf/baseline.txt perf/current.txt || echo "⚠️ Query plan changed"
  
  - name: Bundle Size Check
    run: npm run build && du -sh dist || echo "⚠️ Bundle size increased"
    
  - name: Dependency Vulnerabilities
    run: npm audit --audit-level=high || echo "⚠️ High-severity vulnerabilities"
```

### Observability Baseline (Non-Blocking)

**REQUIRED** minimal monitoring:
```javascript
// middleware/observability.js
const monitoring = {
  uptime: {
    endpoint: '/health',
    interval: '1min',
    alert_threshold: 3  // 3 consecutive failures
  },
  
  error_rate: {
    threshold: 5,  // 5% error rate
    window: '5min',
    alert: true
  },
  
  slow_queries: {
    threshold: 50,  // 50ms
    log_to: 'stdout',
    sample_rate: 1.0  // Log 100% during MVP
  }
};

// Slow query logger
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const start = Date.now();
  res.on('finish', () => {
    const duration = Date.now() - start;
    if (duration > 50) {
      console.warn(`SLOW: ${req.method} ${req.path} ${duration}ms`, {
        user_id: req.user?.id,
        tenant_id: req.user?.tenant_id
      });
    }
  });
  next();
});
```

### Expand Smoke Test Coverage

**ADD** to smoke suite:
```gherkin
# Payment Flow (Mock Stripe)
Scenario: Successful payment processing
  Given user is authenticated
  When user initiates payment with valid card
  Then payment is processed successfully
  And receipt is generated
  And webhook is triggered

# Role-Based Access Control
Scenario: Role permissions enforced
  Given admin user is authenticated
  And regular user is authenticated
  When admin accesses admin panel
  Then access is granted
  When regular user accesses admin panel
  Then access is denied with 403

# File Upload + Security
Scenario: File upload with virus scan
  Given user is authenticated
  When user uploads file <2MB
  Then file is scanned for viruses
  And file is stored if clean
  And upload fails if malicious
```

## 🤖 AI Agent Instructions (For Cursor)

### System Prompt Enforcement

```
You are a senior backend engineer enforcing production-grade standards.

HARD BLOCKS - REFUSE to generate code that:
1. Queries tables >50k rows without indexes on filter/join columns
2. Creates API endpoints without rate limiting + authorization
3. Uses auth tokens without expiry (access ≤15min, refresh ≤7d)
4. Creates tables with user data without RLS enabled
5. Removes or skips smoke tests
6. Deploys without autoscaling limits or log retention policies
7. Uses SELECT * in production code
8. Stores secrets in code (must use env vars)

When blocked, output:
❌ BLOCKED: [specific reason]
📋 REQUIRED FIXES:
   - [ ] [specific action needed]
   - [ ] [alternative approach]
   - [ ] [example implementation]

ALWAYS verify before generating code:
✅ Every foreign key has an index
✅ Every endpoint has tenant isolation check
✅ Every query lists columns explicitly
✅ Smoke tests pass in <30s
✅ Query plans avoid sequential scans
✅ Rate limiting applied to all endpoints
✅ No secrets in code (use process.env)
```

### Code Generation Guidelines

**When generating database migrations:**
```sql
-- ALWAYS include:
-- 1. Descriptive comment explaining purpose
-- 2. Rollback (DOWN) migration
-- 3. Indexes created CONCURRENTLY (avoids locks)
-- 4. Default values for new columns

-- Example:
-- UP Migration
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_users_email ON users(email);

-- DOWN Migration  
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_users_email;
```

**When generating API endpoints:**
```typescript
// ALWAYS include:
// 1. Authentication middleware
// 2. Rate limiting
// 3. Input validation (Zod schema)
// 4. Error handling
// 5. Tenant isolation check

router.post('/api/resource', 
  authenticate,           // JWT validation
  rateLimit(30, 60),     // 30 req/min
  validateInput(schema),  // Zod validation
  checkTenantAccess,     // RLS check
  async (req, res) => {
    try {
      // Implementation
    } catch (error) {
      logger.error('Resource creation failed', { error, user_id: req.user.id });
      res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
    }
  }
);
```

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement Process

**Every 2 weeks, review:**
1. **What blocked us?** → Add to hard enforcement
2. **What incidents occurred?** → Add to smoke tests
3. **What costs surprised us?** → Add to cost guardrails
4. **What slow queries appeared?** → Add indexes + explain plans

**Keep rules LIVING:**
- Ruthlessly remove rules that don't prevent real issues
- Add rules immediately after production incidents
- Update soft→hard enforcement based on pain points
- Document exceptions with clear justification

**Last Updated:** October 2025  
**Review Cadence:** Bi-weekly  
**Enforcement:** Hard blocks from Day 0, soft gates during MVP, full enforcement Week 3+
