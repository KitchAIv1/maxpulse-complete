### **3. PersonalizedNarrativeBuilder.ts** (MAJOR REFACTOR)
**Changes:** Complete BMI √ó Condition matrix for "Reality" text

**NEW buildHardTruth() Logic:**

#### **Critical Conditions (Type 1, Heart, Multiple)**
- **Normal BMI:** "Healthy weight is a major strength, but with [condition], managing lifestyle is CRITICAL..."
- **Obese BMI:** "CRITICAL: Multiple serious conditions combined with obesity significantly multiplies risks..."
- **Other BMI:** "With existing [conditions], managing lifestyle is critical for preventing complications..."

#### **Diabetes (Type 1 or 2)**
- **Normal BMI:** "Healthy weight is excellent for diabetes management! Focus on sleep/hydration/exercise..."
- **Obese BMI:** "Excess weight makes diabetes management harder. Every kg lost improves insulin sensitivity by 3-5%..."
- **Other BMI:** "Managing weight and lifestyle is critical for diabetes control..."

#### **High BP or Kidney Issues**
- **Normal BMI:** "Healthy weight is great! With [condition], maintaining weight and optimizing habits is crucial..."
- **Other BMI:** "Weight management is critical. Losing 10kg could reduce BP by 5-10 points..."

#### **Pregnancy**
- **Normal BMI:** "Healthy weight is ideal for pregnancy! Focus on maintaining good habits..."
- **Other BMI:** "Focus on healthy habits rather than weight loss. Consult OB/GYN..."

#### **No Conditions (Standard)**
- Risk-based text (Critical/High/Moderate/Low) as before

**NEW buildPriorityActions() Logic:**

#### **Action 1: Sleep** (condition-aware)
- **Diabetes:** "Critical for blood sugar regulation"
- **Heart:** "Essential for heart recovery"
- **Standard:** "Set bedtime alarm, put phone away"

#### **Action 2: Hydration** (condition-aware)
- **Kidney:** "Adjusted for kidney function - Consult nephrologist about limits"
- **Heart:** "Adjusted for heart condition - Consult cardiologist about fluid intake"
- **Pregnancy:** "Includes pregnancy needs - Stay well-hydrated"
- **Diabetes:** "Helps regulate blood sugar"
- **Standard:** "Fill bottle in morning, finish by 6 PM"

#### **Action 3: Movement** (condition-aware)
- **Heart:** "Gentle 15-20 min walk - Consult cardiologist before increasing"
- **Pregnancy:** "Moderate 20-25 min walk - Listen to your body, stop if dizzy"
- **High BP:** "Moderate walk - Avoid high-intensity until BP controlled"
- **Diabetes:** "Helps lower blood sugar - Check glucose before/after if needed"
- **Kidney/Liver:** "Gentle walk - Start slow, gradually increase"
- **Standard:** "20-30 min walk - Calendar block it, no excuses"

#### **Action 4: Medical Disclaimer** (conditional)
- **Critical/Compound:** "‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Consult doctor before starting any new regimen"
- **Multiple (2+):** "‚ö†Ô∏è With multiple conditions, coordinate with healthcare team"

---

### **4. PhaseRoadmapGenerator.ts** (ENHANCED)
**Changes:** Phase 3 nutrition guidance now condition-aware

**NEW Phase 3 Warnings:**
- **Diabetes:** "‚ö†Ô∏è Focus on low-glycemic foods and consistent meal timing. Consult dietitian."
- **Heart/High BP:** "‚ö†Ô∏è Focus on low-sodium foods (<1,500mg daily). Consult cardiologist."
- **Digestive:** "‚ö†Ô∏è Introduce changes gradually and note trigger foods."
- **Pregnancy:** "‚ö†Ô∏è Focus on nutrient-dense foods. Consult OB/GYN."

**NEW Diabetes-Specific Nutrition:**
- **Breakfast:** "High-protein, low-carb: 3 eggs + spinach = 300 cal, 24g protein, 2g carbs"
- **Why:** "Stabilizes morning blood sugar and prevents afternoon spikes"
- **Late-night:** "With diabetes, late-night eating causes morning blood sugar spikes"
- **Expected results:** "Better blood sugar control", "Improved A1C trajectory", "Reduced medication needs"
