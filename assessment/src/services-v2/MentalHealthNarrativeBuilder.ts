'no' : mindfulnessPractice} mindfulness practice, and ${socialSupport} social support. This isn't just about mood—this combination is adding 15-20% to your health risks and making weight management feel significantly harder than it should be.

Research shows your current pattern is likely causing:
• 300-500 extra calories stored as belly fat weekly (stress + low energy → overeating + cortisol)
• 40% reduced exercise motivation (low energy → avoidance)
• 35% lower likelihood of sticking to health plans (overwhelm + no support → burnout)
• 23% worse sleep quality (stress prevents deep sleep cycles)

Your stress pattern isn't a personal failure—it's a physiological response that needs addressing. The good news: improving sleep and hydration typically improves stress management and energy within 2-3 weeks, creating a positive momentum shift.

Research shows this is affecting you through:
• 200-300 extra calories from stress-driven eating and reduced activity
• 20-30% lower exercise consistency (energy fluctuations)
• Sleep quality reduced by 15-20% (stress interfering with recovery)

Your mental resilience is moderate—you're managing but could use more support. Adding simple stress resets and building accountability will make everything 30% easier.

You're benefiting from:
• Lower cortisol levels supporting better metabolism
• Better exercise motivation and consistency

Small improvements in ${this.getWeakestMentalArea(stressLevel, energyLevel, mindfulnessPractice, socialSupport)} would further accelerate your progress.

Your strong foundation provides:
• 35% higher likelihood of achieving transformation goals
• Better stress hormone regulation (25% lower cortisol)
• Consistent energy for exercise and healthy habits
• Built-in accountability and encouragement system

Your mental health is actively accelerating your physical transformation. Maintain these practices throughout your journey.
